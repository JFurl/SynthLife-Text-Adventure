Dark Office|
The room in front of you is mostly dark. A stream of yellow light coming in from the slatted blinds to your left.| 
Outside you can see a neon-hued city of high-rise buildings stretching on for what seems like forever.|
The room has only a door on the NORTH wall and a table at its centre. There appears to be a KEY and BOOK on the table.|

R&D|
A large white room with machinery all over the place. There appear to be androids hung up everywhere on metal hooks.|
There is a hole, large enough for a person, in the WEST wall and debris all over the floor. Something came through here or...left in a hurry.|
Sitting on the table in the middle of the room you see a KEY. There is large mechanical door to the NORTH.|

Roof|
The rain pours hard and the fibrant-neon, emanating from the city around you, lights up the night in all directions.|
Something gives you a chill about being up here; you're not sure what. There is a small vent you could squeeze in to the EAST|
You spot a BOX on the other side of the roof.|

Testing Room|
There is what appears to be a partially functioning android slumped in one corner. Only their head and torso remain.|
There are Parts strewn all over the room, half built androids are piled up everywhere.|
You could attempt to talk to the Android. There is no other way out than where you came in.|

Road|
The city towers above you. The rain drenches you. There is a pile of smashed cars in your way stopping you from going father.|
There is a robotic arm laying on the ground.|
There is little else of note.|
